			Want to know how you can make money on trading, but for you this business seems too complicated and confusing?
			Or maybe they have already tried, but leaked a deposit in one of the Forex kitchens? I advise you not to
			abandon this idea, because eToro has made the investment process as accessible as possible for everyone, and
			you are not required to constantly sit by the computer. If you want to know how to earn and / or increase your
			money, then we’ve driven!

			<h2 class="h5">Why eToro?</h2>
			<p>
				Intuitive user-friendly interface that is understandable even for beginners. The ability to invest in stocks of
				global companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Google and many others. Having a demo account on which you need to
				practice before investing real money. Customer support through online chat and personal manager. The main
				feature of social trading is the ability to copy deals of successful investors in auto mode, you just need to
				choose the right traders for you and that’s all. In the traders section there are ready-made lists, such as
				“With the largest number of copyists”, “Best investors”, “Editors' Choice”. The customer’s safety is first of
				all for the company, therefore the system will not allow investing more than 40% of the deposit in one, even a
				very successful trader. The company itself is positioning itself as a social network for traders /
				investors,where users can not only earn, but also communicate with each other.

			<h2 class="h5">EToro story</h2>
			<p>
				The eToro brokerage company was registered back in 2007, and from that moment it has been constantly
				developing. Currently, the number of active traders and investors has exceeded 10 million people from all over
				the world, and this number is growing from year to year. The main reason for the success of the company is
				their unique platform combining a social network and a trading terminal, which allows successful investors to
				copy transactions. But let's talk about everything in order. To get started, let's go through the key points in
				the development of the company:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2007 - foundation of the company</li>
				<li>2009 - opening of WebTrader (access to the trading terminal via a website from anywhere in the world)</li>
				<li>2011 - creation of OpenBook (social trading system / copying transactions)</li>
				<li>2012 - access to the stock market (investments in stocks for greater diversification of investments)</li>
				<li>2013 - release of mobile applications for iPhone and Android</li>
				<li>2015 - website design update (made it more understandable for customers)</li>
				<li>2016 - the advent of CopyPortfolios (the ability to invest not in indices or individual stocks, but in
					their collections, for example CopyPortfolio “BigTech” contains shares of large technology companies)</li>
				<li>2017 - the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning from Microsoft to compile CopyPortfolios (it
					gave greater benefits to investors in CopyPortfolios, because AI chooses more promising stocks)</li>
				<li>2018 - entry into the cryptocurrency market (the opportunity to invest in crypto assets)</li>
				<li>2019 - eToro Wallet is launched and 35 fiat pairs are added to the platform (the ability to buy and sell
					Bitcoin, Ethereum and other popular currencies from a credit card)</li>
				<li>2020 - addition of 185 shares available for investment on the platform</li>
			</ul>
