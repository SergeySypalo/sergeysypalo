			<p>In this article, I have selected a list of the most promising stocks to buy in 2021, consisting mainly of technology companies, but I also added companies from other sectors to diversify.</p>
			<p>For those who are just starting to invest, I recommend looking at social trading, and in particular at eToro, where you can copy transactions of successful investors.</p>
			<p>Here is my <a href="https://www.etoro.com/people/sergey-sypalo/stats" target="_blank">profile</a>, and since May 2020 I have already earned 65%, overtaking the SP500 index by 2 times. The best start would be investing in blue-chip stocks (companies with a capitalization of more than $ 1 billion) + copying transactions of successful traders + leaving money on the balance sheet to buy shares in case of a drawdown. Allocate the budget equally for each asset type.</p>
