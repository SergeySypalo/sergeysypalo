            <ul>
                <li>
                    Lead Platform upgrade to newer firmware and software versions, including architecture redesign, which made virtualization platform more secure and robust to potential hardware failures.

                <li class="mt-2">
                    Based on memory usage analysis, I removed VMs memory reservations, which resulted in ability to host 60% more VMs on the same hardware (2000 servers in 25 datacenters worldwide), so company made some extra money.
                </li>
                <li class="mt-2">
                    Lead (test, document, help other teams) small 10VMs-in-the-lab project which grew into a worldwide deployment (around 2500 VMs) which was successfully sold as a solution to clients and is still in use.
                </li>
                <li class="mt-2">
                    Took over datacenters deployment from third party (expensive) company to internal team and fully automated it, so initial deployment time dropped down from 14 to 2 days and upgrade time - from 15 to 3 months, saving a lot of time and money and allowing teams to spend more time on learning new stuff.
